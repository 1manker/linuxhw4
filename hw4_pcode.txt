initialize a static buffer size to use for all buffers

if there is only one argument in argc then:
   make a buffer
   read lines from stdin and keep track of how many read with variable n
   use fwrite to stdout with the variable n

else(there are arguments)
   
   for each argument
      if the argument is "-"
         make a buffer
         read lines from stdin and keep track of how many read with variable n
         use fwrite to stdout with variable n

      else (the argument is not "-")
         assume this argument is a file
         make a file pointer
         try to open file
         if file does not exist
            print error message and move on
         else if the file exists
            make a buffer
            read chars with stdin
            count the chars read, store in variable n
            use fwrite to stdout using the variable n

return
